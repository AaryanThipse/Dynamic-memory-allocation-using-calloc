<b><ins>C calloc() method</b></ins><br>
“calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type. it is very much similar to malloc() but has two different points and these are:<br>
1.It initializes each block with a default value ‘0’.<br>
2.It has two parameters or arguments as compare to malloc().<br>
<br>
<b>Syntax: </b>
ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);<br>
